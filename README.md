# TSEdit


This is a project based on an older project I was working on [here](https://github.com/LilithTundrus/js-dos-edit) designed to capture the spirit of editing text files in the DOS `EDIT` command in a more modern enviornment using a language I understand best.

Right now this is very early on and most of the first parts of this will be aiming to just get back to where the previous project left off
