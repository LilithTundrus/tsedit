# Initial Design Draft

__(This doc is just for laying out my ideas for the project)__


# Authors: Lilith Tundrus



# What this project is:

- This is design to imitate how DOS's old `EDIT` program worked, but compatable with modern tech

## Base Intended Features:
- Easy to understand editing of documents
- Ability to visually select code, simular to vi's visual mode
- Ability to open and save files
- Edit text (logically!)
- Open Files
- Get the current directory for saving files
- Write (text based) files to disk
- Support file sizes above 16k
- Line + Column count
- Menu system
- Undo/Redo system
- Cut/Copy/Paste support
- Title that matches the current document
- Keyboard shortcuts
- About dialog
- Open dialog
- Save dialog

## Nice-to-haves:

- Syntax highlighting
- Autocompletion
- Find and replace
- Some sort of preferences system for things like tab v. spaces/etc.
- Tabbed workspace (multiple windows within the editor)


# What this project is NOT:
- This is not meant to be an exact copy of DOS `EDIT`, just very similar
